                    Pocket PubMed started as a final project for a computer science course I was
                    taking to boost my knowledge outside of what I learned in school. It quickly grew to become more than that.
                    Even after turning it in, I continued to work on it and add features -- it's still in progress!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The central idea behind Pocket PubMed is to take NIH's medical and research paper database, PubMed,
                    and create a mobile version that could be easily accessible from a user's phone. 
                    It includes a search bar, which uses JSON requests to fetch information from PubMed's open database
                    and creates a scrolling infinite list of formatted articles, a history tab that displays
                    previous searches made (sorted by timestamp), and a currently-in-progress favorites bar
                    that will allow users to save certain articles for later use (say, if you were a college student looking for academic resources.)
