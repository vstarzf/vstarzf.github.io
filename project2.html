                    Pexcel was the first independent coding project I worked on. I developed it
                    over the summer during COVID quarantine as a way to engage myself when I couldn't really do anything else.

                    Pexcel was "commissioned" by my older sister, who was working as a scientist
                    in the pharmaceutical research industry. They had a task that involved
                    manually going through an excel sheet, taking the information, and formatting
                    it into a different excel sheet. My task was to automate this job so that
                    an employee would only have to select the file to be processed, saving many hours
                    of work. Additionally, I also built a small GUI so that the program could 
                    be operated easily without command line prompts.
