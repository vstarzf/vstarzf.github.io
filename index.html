                        Hi. Welcome to the introduction page! My name is Veronica Starchenko and I will be attending Cornell University in the fall to study Computer Science at the College of Engineering. I have been coding for about 3-4 years and this website will focus on the independent projects I've worked on.
                        
                    </p>

                    Although I had a very early start in computer science when I created HTML profiles for people on forums, I didn't really start fully coding until my sophomore year of high school, where I took AP Computer Science Principles and discovered that I loved programming. I continued to take computer science classes in school, such as AP Computer Science A and a data structures class, as well as outside courses online such as CS50x and Codecademy.
